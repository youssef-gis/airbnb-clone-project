# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. 
It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. 

## Team Roles

This section outlines the key roles and responsibilities for the project team. Understanding these roles is crucial for effective collaboration and project success.

| Role | Description & Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project Manager (PM)** | The central leader responsible for planning, execution, and delivery. Manages timeline, budget, resources, and stakeholder communication to ensure project goals are met. |
| **Backend Developer** | Designs and implements server-side logic, databases, and APIs. Focuses on performance, security, scalability, and the core application architecture. |
| **Frontend Developer** | Builds the user-facing side of the application. Implements visual and interactive elements using web technologies to create a responsive and engaging user experience. |
| **Full Stack Developer** | Works across both frontend and backend layers. Handles everything from server and database management to client-side UI, providing end-to-end feature development. |
| **Database Administrator (DBA)** | Manages the database systems. Responsibilities include schema design, data integrity, query optimization, security, and implementing backup/recovery strategies. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Automates and streamlines development and operations. Manages CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and monitoring tools to ensure reliable and frequent deployments. |
| **UI/UX Designer** | Designs the user experience and interface. Researches user needs, creates wireframes and prototypes, and designs the visual elements to ensure the product is intuitive and user-friendly. |
| **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer** | Ensures software quality. Writes and executes test plans (manual and automated), identifies and reports bugs, and validates that features work as intended before release. |
| **Product Owner (PO)** | Represents stakeholder and customer interests. Defines the product vision, prioritizes the feature backlog, and works with the team to ensure the right product is being built. |
| **Scrum Master** | Acts as a facilitator for the agile team. Removes impediments, coaches the team on Scrum practices, and ensures a smooth and productive workflow during development sprints. |

## Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern, robust set of technologies chosen for their scalability, developer efficiency, and performance.

| Technology | Purpose in the Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Django** | A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend RESTful APIs. It provides the core application logic, security, and URL routing, following the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | A powerful and flexible toolkit built on top of Django for building Web APIs. It is used to serialize data, handle authentication, and create the API endpoints efficiently. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A powerful, open-source object-relational database system. It is used as the primary database to store, manage, and provide reliable access to the application's structured data. |
| **GraphQL** | A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries. It is used to provide a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need. |
| **React** | A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is used to construct the frontend client, creating reusable UI components and managing the application's state efficiently. |
| **Docker** | A platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It is used to ensure consistency across development, staging, and production environments and to simplify deployment. |
| **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** | A cloud computing platform. It is used to host the application's infrastructure, including virtual servers (EC2), database instances (RDS), and storage solutions (S3), providing scalability and reliability. |
